  <h4>Complexity Defined</h4>
  <blockquote>
    "Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify
    the system."

        Cyclomatic complexity: number of linearly independent paths with a piece of source code (Thomas McCabe, 1976)

        Cyclomatic complexity is not perfect, but it can tell you how many unit tests you'd need to test the function

      It's not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster.

      Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a
      developer is to facilitate those future extensions.

      Your job as a developer is not just to create code that <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> can work with
