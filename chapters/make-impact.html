  <h4>Engineering at Stripe</h4>
  <blockquote style="text-align: left; font-size: large">
    <p>"Stripe didn't have the Product Manager (PM) role for a long time, which has had an impact on engineering.</p>
    <p>
      Engineers participate in all parts of the product development process: figuring out business scope, talking to
      users, collaborating with designers, lawyers, accountants, etc. They don't only do software development, as is
      common at ‚Äútraditional‚Äù companies. I'd compare Stripe's approach to product-minded engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days, this meant engineers did a lot of what PMs do. These days, Stripe has found it's helpful for
      engineers to partner with PMs because the number of features and products has grown. Stripe now has many PMs and
      product folks who add a ton of value. That being said, Stripe still expects engineers to be close to users and
      involved in the process, end-to-end. Staying close helps the feedback loop stay tight, and ensures Stripe builds
      things users want."
