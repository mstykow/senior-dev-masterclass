# Senior Dev Masterclass

## Abstract

What does it take to be an effective team lead?

In this masterclass we'll explore the dimensions it takes to be more than just an exceptional individual contributor:

- develop yourself as a technical team lead while maintaining balance between management and technical duties
- build strong teams by instilling purpose, fostering excellence, and providing autonomy
- improve the development process by measuring performance, removing team distractions, and focusing on value rather than just more features

This class is for experienced developers who already know how to build good software but want to make a bigger impact on the team and the project as a whole. It's not a course about coding but about solving problems as a team and increasing your personal leverage.
